# Fake Enterprise Environment – Honeypot README

## Overview
This server contains a simulated enterprise file environment created for:

- Attacker interaction tracking  
- Threat intelligence collection  
- SOC and detection engineering  
- AI-based security analysis  
- Deception research  

All files, folders, credentials, and artifacts are fake and intentionally crafted as bait.  
No real sensitive data exists in this environment.

---

## Environment Contents

### 1. Fake User Profiles
The following directories simulate real corporate users:

- `/home/jsmith/`
- `/home/mmiller/`
- `/home/irivera/`
- `/home/twilliams/`
- `/home/backupsvc/`

Each folder includes documents appropriate to their “role.”

---

### 2. Fake Sensitive Files
Created to mimic high-value enterprise data:

- Financial reports  
- Payroll records  
- HR case files  
- Employee master lists  
- IT configuration backups  
- Backup logs and encryption keys  

All content is safe and intentionally fake.

---

### 3. Fake Secrets & Credentials
Intentionally created for deception and attacker interaction:

- `passwords.txt`  
- `.aws-credentials`  
- `.id_rsa`  
- Fake API keys  
- Fake database passwords  
- Fake service account details  

These do not map to any real systems or accounts.

---

### 4. Fake Corporate Structure
Located under `/opt/corp/` to simulate internal IT infrastructure:

/opt/corp/
 ├── Config/
 ├── Secrets/
 ├── Systems/
 └── Network/

This structure provides context for lateral movement attempts.

---

## Purpose
This environment supports:

- Studying attacker behavior  
- Logging malicious activity  
- Feeding SIEM/SOC pipelines  
- Training AI-based detection and analysis tools  
- Practicing deception engineering  

No production data is involved.

---

## Important Notes

- All files and credentials are intentionally fake  
- No real sensitive data is stored  
- Do not add real corporate or personal data  
- Environment is strictly for security research
